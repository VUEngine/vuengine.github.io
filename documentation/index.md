# Introduction

VUEngine Studio is a custom integrated development environment (IDE), tailor-made for [Nintendo Virtual Boy](https://www.virtual-boy.com) game development with [VUEngine](https://github.com/VUEngine/VUEngine-Core), our versatile, object oriented Virtual Boy game engine.

As the end result, it can generate ROM files (`.vb`) that can be run in an emulator or, via a flash cart, on actual Virtual Boy hardware.

To get started, check out the following sections of this documentation.

- [Setup](/documentation/setup/installation/): to get your copy of VUEngine Studio up and running.
- [Basics](/documentation/basics/user-interface/): to get to know the IDE and the most important of its many features.
- [Language](/documentation/language/introduction/): to learn about Virtual C, our custom C dialect.
- [User Guide](/documentation/user-guide/introduction/): to learn how to actually develop games with VUEngine Studio and VUEngine, the engine you'll build upon.
- [Tutorials](/documentation/tutorials/video-tutorials/): for a different approach to learn working with VUEngine Studio (well... once anything is up there).
- [FAQ](/documentation/faq/): for an overview of the most frequently asked questions.

> **BTW**: The name "VUEngine" (pronounced as "View Engine") is a portmanteau of the Virtual Boyâ€™s original code name, "VUE" (short for "Virtual Utopia Experience"), and the word "Engine".
