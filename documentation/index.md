# Introduction

Hello! I am the VUEngine Studio documentation.

**I am incomplete and still being written. Partially even outdated. Beware!**

VUEngine Studio is a custom integrated development environment (IDE), tailor-made for <a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com">Nintendo Virtual Boy</a> game development with <a href="https://github.com/VUEngine/VUEngine-Core">VUEngine</a>, our versatile, object oriented Virtual Boy game engine.

Check out the following sections:

- <a href="/documentation/setup/installation/">Setup</a>: to get your copy of VUEngine Studio up and running.
- <a href="/documentation/basics/user-interface/">Basics</a>: to get to know the IDE and the most important of its many features.
- <a href="/documentation/user-guide/building/">User Guide</a>: to learn how to actually develop games with VUEngine Studio.
- <a href="/documentation/engine/introduction/">Engine</a>: to learn about VUEngine, the engine you'll build upon.
- <a href="/documentation/tutorials/video-tutorials/">Tutorials</a>: for a different approach to learn working with VUEngine Studio (well... once anything is up there).

> **BTW**: The name "VUEngine" (pronounced as "View Engine") is based on the Virtual Boyâ€™s code name, "VUE" or "Virtual Utopia Experience".
