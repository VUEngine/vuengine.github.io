# Introduction

VUEngine Studio is a custom integrated development environment (IDE), tailor-made for <a href="https://www.virtual-boy.com">Nintendo Virtual Boy</a> game development with <a href="https://github.com/VUEngine/VUEngine-Core">VUEngine</a>, our versatile, object oriented Virtual Boy game engine.

As the end result, it can generate ROM files (`.vb`) that can be run in an emulator or, via a flash cart, on actual Virtual Boy hardware.
