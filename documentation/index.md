# Introduction

[VUEngine Studio](https://www.vuengine.dev/) is a custom integrated development environment (IDE), tailor-made for [Nintendo Virtual Boy](https://www.virtual-boy.com) game development with [VUEngine](https://github.com/VUEngine/VUEngine-Core), our versatile, object oriented Virtual Boy game engine. As the end result, it can generate ROM files (`.vb`) that can be run in an emulator or, via a flash cart, on actual Virtual Boy hardware.

This documentation consists of the following sections:

- [Setup](/documentation/setup/installation/): to get your copy of VUEngine Studio up and running.
- [Basics](/documentation/basics/getting-started/): to get to know the IDE and the most important of its many features.
- [Language](/documentation/language/introduction/): to learn about Virtual C, our custom C dialect.
- [User Guide](/documentation/user-guide/introduction/): to learn about the design principles and concepts of VUEngine, the engine you'll build upon.
- [API](/documentation/api/classes/): for an API documentation of VUEngine's classes.
- [Tutorial](/documentation/tutorial/introduction/): for a step-by-step tutorial that implements a simple game with VUEngine Studio.
- [FAQ](/documentation/faq/): for an overview of the most frequently asked questions.

You might just want to skip most of that and start off with the [tutorial](/documentation/tutorial/introduction/) to start making your first game. You can still come back to the other sections later to deepen your knowledge of e.g. VUEngine's concepts.

> **BTW**: The name "VUEngine" (pronounced as "View Engine") is a portmanteau of the Virtual Boyâ€™s original code name, "VUE" (short for "Virtual Utopia Experience"), and the word "Engine".
