# Introduction

In this step-by-step tutorial we will be creating a simple Nintendo Virtual Boy game with [VUEngine Studio](https://www.vuengine.dev/).

The game we will implement is Pong, which should cover all the basic needs for a game, from stages, states and game logic to sprites and collisions.

> **P.S.**: The finished code that we will be produced in the course of this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/VUEngine/Pong).
