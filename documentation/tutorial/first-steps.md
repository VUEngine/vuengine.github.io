# First Steps

Now that we have our project set up and confirmed that it's building and running just fine, it's time to dive into the code. First of all, let's have a look at what our project currently consists of.

## Project structure

Each [VUEngine](https://github.com/VUEngine/VUEngine-Core) based projects's files are organized in the following folders and files:

<a href="/documentation/images/tutorial/project-structure.png" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="gallery" data-caption="Project structure"><img src="/documentation/images/tutorial/project-structure.png" /></a>

- **assets**: This folder holds the assets of the game, like images, sounds and stages
- **config**: In this folder live various editor files that help to customize the engine's behavior to suit the game's needs
- **headers**: Various header files, like those generated by [VUEngine Studio](https://www.vuengine.dev/) are place in this folder
- **lib**: Here are placed the files used by the linker to generate the playable ROM
- **source**: The files in this folder implement the game's logic
- *config.make*: This auto generated file holds various parameters that are required by the build chain to create the game's ROM
- *pong.workspace*: This is the project file that [VUEngine Studio](https://www.vuengine.dev/) uses

## First run

When starting your game in the emulator earlier, you'll have seen things like a precaution screen, an IPD/focus adjustment screen, etc, and you might be wondering where those are coming from. The answer is simple: plugins!

The Barebone template project includes various standard splash screens that mimick officially developed games, like adjustment and precautions screens. Those are provided as plugins that can be installed or removed through the IDE:

Once the plugins are installed, their usage depends on what functionality each provides. In the case of the splash screens, they are used to start the game, so, lets see how they are used.

## Game's entry point

In the **source** folder, you there is a file called *Game.c* and, inside it, you will find a function called `game` that returns an instance of `GameState`:

```cpp
GameState game(void)
{
    // Initialize plugins
    AutomaticPauseManager::setActive
    (
        AutomaticPauseManager::getInstance(),
        GameSaveDataManager::getAutomaticPauseStatus(GameSaveDataManager::getInstance())
    );

    I18n::setActiveLanguage
    (
        I18n::getInstance(), GameSaveDataManager::getLanguage(GameSaveDataManager::getInstance())
    );

    SplashScreenState::setNextState
    (
        SplashScreenState::safeCast(PrecautionScreenState::getInstance()),
        GameState::safeCast(AdjustmentScreenState::getInstance())
    );

    SplashScreenState::setNextState
    (
        SplashScreenState::safeCast(AdjustmentScreenState::getInstance()),
        GameState::safeCast(AutomaticPauseSelectionScreenState::getInstance())
    );

    SplashScreenState::setNextState
    (
        SplashScreenState::safeCast(AutomaticPauseSelectionScreenState::getInstance()),
        GameState::safeCast(LanguageSelectionScreenState::getInstance())
    );

    SplashScreenState::setNextState
    (
        SplashScreenState::safeCast(LanguageSelectionScreenState::getInstance()),
        GameState::safeCast(MyGameState::getInstance())
    );

    // Return the first GameState
    return GameState::safeCast(PrecautionScreenState::getInstance());
}
```

The engine internally calls the global `game` function for it to return the first [GameState](/documentation/api/class-game-state/) that the engine's [StateMachine](/documentation/api/class-state-machine/) must enter into. In this case, it is the `PrecautionScreenState`.

Various other initialization steps can be performed in the `game` function before returning the control back to the engine. The template project already does some common tasks, like enabling the `AutomaticPauseManager`, that takes care of pausing the game after a fixed amount of time has passed to remember the player to rest regularly. To change the configurations of plugins, select the "Configuration" tab from each's page in the plugin explorer:

<a href="/documentation/images/tutorial/automatic-pause-manager-configuration.png" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="gallery" data-caption="Automatic Pause Manager configuration"><img src="/documentation/images/tutorial/automatic-pause-manager-configuration.png"/></a>

But the most important above is the chain of states that is setup and that ends with `MyGameState`. The `PrecautionScreenState` inherits from `SplashScreenState`, which can be configured to change the engine's state to an arbitrary [GameState](/documentation/api/class-game-state/). In the template project, it is setup to instruct the engine to enter the `AdjustmentScreenState` when it exits. The sequence will make the engine to enter the following states:

1) `PrecautionScreenState`

2) `AdjustmentScreenState`

3) `AutomaticPauseSelectionScreenState`

4) `LanguageSelectionScreenState`

5) `MyGameState`

From these, `MyGameState` is the first [GameState](/documentation/api/class-game-state/) of the game that is not a plugin's and, as such, where the game's logic actually starts.

During development, it makes sense to skip those splash screens and go directly to the [GameState](/documentation/api/class-game-state/) that is being implemented. This can be easily done by returning that state in the `game` function:

```cpp
SplashScreenState::setNextState
(
    return GameState::safeCast(MyGameState::getInstance());
);
```

Once the project is rebuilt and run, the following screen will show up right away:
