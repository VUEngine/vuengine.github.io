      Apart from the usual bug fixes and usability improvements, the highlights of this release are the improved 
      build times and the new image quantizer that runs before conversion. Previously, images had to be indexed 
      PNGs using the correct palette. Now, users do no longer have to worry about such things. In this context, 
      the entity editor now also allows you to create HiColor (7 color frame blending) sprites. In addition, the 
      font editor has been completely redesigned and now allows to create fonts of any size.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Added various quantisation options to image editor and entity editor's sprite component<br>
      - Reduced build times by building libraries only once and using only the CPU's performance cores<br>
      - Redesigned font editor<br>
      - Redesigned application shell<br>
      - Various QOL enhancements, addressing user feedback<br>

      Apart from the usual bug fixes and usability improvements, one highlight of this release is the ability to extract
      editors to secondary windows. Furthermore, a new second built-in emulator config allows you to wirelessly send
      ROMs to a Nintendo 3DS running the Red Viper emulator for quick testing.
